demonstrate some minds,I think this mind let program look clear and resource quickly release and easy error process.

Taking helloworldmethod2.c as an example, facing complex situations, "try and try and try" to use a goto statement to jump to a unique error process  code block for "EACH" error. this makes it easier to backtrack and analyze each error handling path. all normal malloc and free are at the same indentation depth.

    Some preliminary rough analysis of the result of 1+2*2+3*3+4*4+5*5+......n*n and the volume calculation of the square cone.

A superficial analysis
I noticed that the mass-energy equivalence equation seems to be roughly equal to twice the kinetic energy. I've come up with a method: Consider a third frame of reference, not fixed to the Earth. Assume the Earth is stationary. On the Earth is an object B5 (with a relatively small mass, C1) with zero velocity. B5 is connected to the Earth by a rope that is extremely strong, elastic, and very light. Its stretching force is negligible, but its range of action is extremely wide, and its velocity is the speed of light. The object is essentially unable to escape the rope. There is also a person with mass C1, also connected to the Earth by the same rope. Both the person and object B5 are on an extremely smooth plane. The person pushes object B5, causing B5 to move relative to the Earth... In a non-fixed third-party frame of reference, the ball reaches a speed of V1. V1 is not very large. According to the reaction force, the energy generated by the reaction force on the person should be the same as the kinetic energy gained by object B5, but in the opposite direction. At this time, the tension of the rope begins to play a role. Ultimately, under the action of the tension, twice the kinetic energy of B5 flows within the combined body of the Earth, the person, and object B5. If the person pushes object B5 to the speed of light, then the result is the same as the result calculated by the mass-energy equivalence equation. As for why the double kinetic energy effect is not obvious for low-speed objects but obvious for objects moving at the speed of light, it is like how a person walking in the air has little resistance, but when exceeding the speed of sound, a sonic boom is generated and the person experiences enormous pressure.


The above paragraph provided a rough clew that helped me summarize my previous thoughts and prompted further reflection. See below.





Some conjectures

An ordered field contains a medium. Energy is rapidly transferred through this medium. Energy clusters cut through the medium, and multiple cuts form medium fragments. These fragments may curl and contract to form electrons. Energy clusters in a chaotic state may dissipate rapidly due to the healing effect of the medium. Imagine a ring stopped by a smooth obstacle. A thick rod passes through the space in the center of the ring, causing it to rotate. Large medium fragments might form such rotating rings, much like protons.

Electrons might be formed by the random curling and contraction of medium fragments into spheres. Positrons might, in rare cases, form rings, making collisions and annihilation between positrons and electrons more likely. The case of a particle being its own antiparticle might resemble a hollow gear; two hollow gears rotating in opposite directions and coming together are prone to annihilation.


It is very important to note that the following are some conjectures, translated into English by machine:

The dominant factor in electromagnetism is the contraction of the ordered field medium segment, i.e., the electron.
The dominant factor in strong interaction is the rapid back-and-forth oscillation of the overall ordered field at the fracture point.
To cope with this extreme oscillation, the ring-shaped medium block, i.e., the proton, undergoes a "special inward and outward flipping motion." The electron, situated between these two extreme motions, exists in a kind of "equilibrium state," which I believe is why electrons are largely absent from strong interaction.
Gravity may be the macroscopic manifestation of this "extreme oscillation."

For weak interaction, in negative beta decay, the "hollow part" of the ring-shaped medium block, i.e., the proton, during contraction, confines the electron, causing it to escape and "produce" antineutrinos. Positive beta decay may involve energy impacting the narrow hollow part of the ring-shaped medium block, producing ring-shaped positrons and electron neutrinos. The energy also enlarges the hollow part of the ring-shaped medium block to a certain extent, allowing the produced electrons to continuously pass through, thus forming neutrons. This suggests that this process may require external energy input.
